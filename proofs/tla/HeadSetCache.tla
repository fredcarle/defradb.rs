---- MODULE HeadSetCache ----
EXTENDS HeadSet

\* The durable transitions are the existing HeadSet operators. Cache publication
\* and snapshot capture share an atomic boundary, not an application-transaction
\* lock. A real cache copies raw values unchanged and has a byte budget; eviction
\* is always permitted. An old reader pins its own immutable version.
